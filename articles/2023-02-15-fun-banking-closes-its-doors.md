# Fun Banking Closes Its Doors

Dear Fun Banking users,

Unfortunately we have some difficult news to share.

We will be bringing down Fun Banking and taking it offline. We created this application to encourage
financial responsibility skills to individuals. Unfortunately, the service that
we were hosting our website on took away it's free tier; and since Fun Banking
is _not in the business of making money_, we will be shutting down on **July 01, 2023 at 12:00AM**

This has been an amazing journey for me creating this application, and having people use it.
Over the past two years it has:

- Been [featured in the news](https://dailyvoice.com/connecticut/hartford/schools/an-incredible-honor-connecticut-teacher-wins-national-award/834925/)
- Over 1,000 registered accounts
- Over 5,000 customers
- Over 10,000 transactions

Our closing date of July 01, 2023 is to help the teachers who currently rely on Fun Banking to
finish out the school year. However, this means that we will **not** be here for next year.

<h1>❤️ We Thank all of our Educators</h1>
