# ðŸŒŠ The Deep End 

Personally, I don't know how to swim.  If I started to learn how to swim by going in the deep end at first, I'd be scared. Even if there's a coach, or lifeguard there. 
Why? It's a matter of trust.  I believe that starting someone in the deep end, software or otherwise, is beneficial when the support they need is there. This same
principle applies to software engineering. Particularly those who are maybe just starting their careers.

This month we've had our summer interns start this summer at The Hartford; and I've been helping out with the program. These interns are excited and want that 
real-world, meaningful experience (kudos)! We should give it to them. We should have them join the team meetings, participate in pull requests, and even make commits to the
GitHub repository that their team is working on. It's extremely important to give these early-career folks that support they need when doing it. Whether or not
they want to admit it, they're probably nervous about what other's think about their code.  In fact, many of them openly admitted to this. 

For those early career folks &mdash; some of the best piece of advice I've gotten so far in my career is to **be vulnerable**. Put yourself (code) out there! It'll open many opportunities for you and,
if you have a good team, they'll offer advice (and praise!) about your work. Give that senior person on your team a review on their pull request; after all, they're humans too. The worst thing you can 
do is to hide until you _think_ you have your best work out there. Often times, you won't know how your feature will need to work until someone else sees it.

On the flip side, if you have interns on your team, or at your company; consider starting them in the deep end. Create a safe-space for them to fail too, take time with them
and coach them. The future you will thank yourself for it.
