# Shall We Code A Game?

The Hartford wanted to prove itself as a work destination for software engineers
throughout the world. In order to capture this, we thought we would have some fun,
thought-provoking game challenges that engineers can do during their free time.
They would own the code that they create and we'll never see it; so you can code with
confidence.
