# I Run This State

In September of 2022 I decided to join the Run 169 Society, where we
run every town in the state of Connecticut. I convinced my sisters to
join me in Hartford for the Hartford Marathon Relay and we finished in less
than 5 hours together.

Currently, I am at my 15th town and actively getting more. You can check out
my progress on the official [Run 169 Society](https://run169towns.org) website.
