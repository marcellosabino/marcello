# Website Redesign

I created this website from scratch. With some big updates to the "frontend" world with
Angular v16 and NextJS v13, I figured now was a good time to experiment with both
frameworks since at work I only get to use Angular v15.

I started this redesign because I am also looking to change jobs. After 6 years in the insurance
industry, I think I want to start branching out. At the very least, get involved in some newer
trends (I.E. not Java).

I decided to use NextJS for this website due to it's static-site generation at
build time. I also wanted to change my usual framework (Angular) and play around with NextJS.
Having the website be statically generated allows me to have my blogs in the code-base and
not need a backend server.

Some improvements over version one of my website &mdash;

- Dark theme and Light theme
- Portfolio
- Dedicated Articles page
- Office setup (for the stalkers)
- Download my Resume
- Fresh, modern look
- Updated profile picture ðŸ˜‰

As always, my website's code can be found on my [personal GitHub](https://github.com/marcellosabino/marcello). Feel free to stay on my site and snoop around.

Shoutout to Spencer Sharp and TailwindCSS Labs for the design that I based mine off of, but deviated slightly from.
