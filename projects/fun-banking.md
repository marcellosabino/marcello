# Fun Banking

You can check out the application at the following URL: https://fun-banking.com

Fun Banking was created in cooperation with special education teachers in Connecticut. They wanted an application that enabled students to become more fiscally responsible. Students would be awarded monetary prizes (within the Fun Bank) and they would be able to withdraw from their savings to buy real-life goods, like lunch. The application was built with simplicity in mind for both the students and the teachers.

Since the teachers wanted to begin using this tool as soon as possible, I decided to go with Ruby on Rails. Ruby on Rails is an older web-framework, but
it does allow developers to move very fast. This was exactly the thing that I needed due to the timeline I was given. In addition, I knew this didn't need
to scale right away, so for my initial audience, this did the job well.

Over the course of the two years that Fun Banking was online, we:

- Helped 1,000+ teachers
- Supported 5,000+ students
- Successfully managed 12,000+ transactions
- Were [featured on the news](https://dailyvoice.com/connecticut/hartford/schools/an-incredible-honor-connecticut-teacher-wins-national-award/834925/)

Below you'll find some screenshots of the application, since unfortunately, [fun banking is closing it's doors](https://marcello.codes/articles/2023-02-15-fun-banking-closes-its-doors).
