# The Hartford's Coding Challenge

Test your coding mettle with [The Hartford's Coding Challenge](https://coding-challenge.thehartford.com).
I worked on this project with a small group of motivated engineers who wanted to attract engineering
talent to The Hartford. We wanted to try something new, and since we primarily use Angular as our
"go-to" framework at The Hartford, in Middle and Large Commercial at least, we created this
application with React, Vite, and Monaco. There is no backend since we did not want to track users
and give them a safe-space to have some fun and code!

What are you still doing here? Go try a challenge!
